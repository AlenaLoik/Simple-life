                        <h2> Work is often a major source of stress.</h2>
                        <p>
                            Some text about work.<br>
                            <strong>I used to be a pack rat.</strong>
                            I had so many things that I thought that I loved,
                            but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.<br>
                            Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in,
                            and I couldn't hold a relationship.<br>
                            <a href="#"> I turned things around </a><br>
                            <strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</strong>
                            I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage,
                            sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.<br>
                            It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place,
                            I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.<br>
                            <a href="#"> I live the simple life </a><br>
                            Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better.
                            I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.<br>
                            With how much it turned my life around,
                            <strong>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it,</strong>
                            and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this
                            site!
